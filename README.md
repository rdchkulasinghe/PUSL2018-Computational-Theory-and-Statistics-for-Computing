# PUSL2018 Coursework
## Overview
<p>This repository contains the code and report for the PUSL2018 coursework, which focuses on Monte Carlo simulation and statistical probability. The project is divided into two main tasks</p>

### Monte Carlo Simulation:
- Simulating marble drops into circular and rectangular trays.
- Estimating the value of pi.
- Analyzing the convergence of pi estimates with increasing simulation iterations.
- Statistical Probability:

### Calculating the probability of specific outcomes in a three-child family.
### Simulating dice rolls to determine the probability of a specific sum.
